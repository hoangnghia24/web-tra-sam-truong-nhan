# PROJECT CHECKPOINT

Project: Truong Nhan Digital Campaign

## Current Status

Current checkpoint: CP-03
Status: IN_PROGRESS
Last completed checkpoint: CP-02 (verified; commit pending). CP-01 was committed as `d2022cd`; CP-00 as `d8a6b16`; source audit as `d43d066`.

## Completed Work

- Verified cover image at the requested path and reviewed its contents.
- Found the 38-page strategy PDF at `public/references/`, rather than the requested `references/` path; extracted and inspected representative pages.
- Created a first checkpoint system and committed source audit (`d43d066`).
- Received the Master Prompt after that commit and moved records to its required `docs/` directory.
- Downloaded self-hosted Spectral and Mulish from Google Fonts with OFL license files; verified representative Vietnamese glyphs.
- Created an uncommitted static visual prototype. It does not satisfy the Next.js application requirement and must be migrated.
- Initialized Next.js 16.4.4 App Router with React 19.3.1, strict TypeScript, Tailwind 4, ESLint and requested app libraries. Removed the temporary static prototype source.
- Next.js development server returned HTTP 200 on `http://localhost:3000/`; production build, lint, and typecheck passed.
- Completed CP-01 shared header/footer and PageBanner, responsive typography tokens, and full 16:9 hero with CTAs in a separate content block. Verified mobile navigation and font rendering in browser.
- Completed CP-02 content/seed JSON, Zod schemas, atomic queued JSON storage with backups, JSON validation script, public API foundation, and four storage tests.

## Current Task

Build CP-03 landing page: eight distinct sections linking to real campaign routes, using the source's story and brand visuals.

## Files Being Modified

- `src/app/page.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/components/home/*`

## Tests Passed

- Source existence and PDF page count checks.
- Six font files contain the checked Vietnamese glyph sample.
- Static prototype built and returned HTTP 200, but this is not the target application.
- `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck` passed for the Next.js skeleton.
- GET `http://localhost:3000/` returned HTTP 200.
- `npm audit --omit=dev --audit-level=moderate` found 0 production vulnerabilities.
- CP-01 `npm run build`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run typecheck` passed.
- All six font files contain required Vietnamese glyphs; browser computed fonts are Mulish for body and Spectral for H1.
- Desktop and 390 px mobile inspection showed the complete 16:9 cover; mobile width 390 px with document scroll width 375 px. Mobile menu opened and closed.
- CP-02 `npm run validate:json`, `npm run test` (4 tests), `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` passed.
- Public API GETs returned HTTP 200; invalid receipt input returned 400; direct runtime URL returned 404.

## Known Issues

- The Next.js app has only the homepage intro; feature routes and admin features are not yet implemented.
- Public write API happy paths must be tested alongside their UI features; CP-02 verified storage writes in isolated tests and invalid receipt rejection.
- Typography must be reviewed again across the six requested routes after those pages exist.
- `npm install` reported 16 moderate vulnerabilities including dev dependencies; production-only audit found 0. Review during CP-10.
- Official purchase URL is not supplied, so no buy link should be shown.

## Next Actions

1. Build eight homepage sections with clear paths to the feature routes.
2. Test desktop/mobile layout and navigation; update source-informed copy as needed.
3. Verify CP-03, record results and commit before CP-04.

## Resume Command

Read `AGENTS.md`, `docs/MASTER_PROMPT.md`, `docs/CHECKPOINT.md`, `docs/TASKS.md`, `docs/DECISIONS.md`, and `docs/TEST_RESULTS.md`. Inspect source and continue from CP-03. Do not repeat completed work.
